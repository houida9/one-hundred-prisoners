The 100 prisoners problem is a mathematical problem proposed by computer scientist Peter Bro Miltersen in 2003.

In this problem, 100 numbered prisoners must find their own numbers in one of 100 drawers in order to survive. Each prisoner may enter the room one at a time and check 50 boxes. They must leave the room exactly as they found it and can't communicate with the others after. If all 100 prisoners find their number during their turn in the room, they will all be freed. But if even one fails, they will all be executed. What's their best strategy?

Probability of all inmates surviving without a strategy (random) is 1/2^100
Probability of all inmates surviving with the loop strategy is ~31%
